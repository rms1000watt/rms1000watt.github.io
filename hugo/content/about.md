### Building Tech

Trained in Physics and Engineering. Working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Lantern Credit](http://www.lanterncredit.com). Interested in Software, Hardware, IT, Data Science, Physics, IoT, etc. I'm a fantastic technical writer but not much of a creative writer, so expect this blog to be right to the point, lol.
